## Join All The Things

```sql
Select s.customer_id, s.order_date, m.product_name, m.price,
case when me.join_date > s.order_date then 'N'
	when me.join_date <= s.order_date THEN 'Y'

## Rank All The Things

```sql
with CTE as (
	select s.customer_id, s.order_date, product_name, price,
	case 
		when join_date is NULL then 'N'
		when join_date > order_date then 'N'
		else 'Y'
	end as members 
	from dbo.sales s
	inner join menu as m 
	on s.product_id = m.product_id
	left join dbo.members me
	on s.customer_id = me.customer_id
)

select *, 
	case
		When members = 'N' then NULL
		else rank() over(partition by customer_id, members order by order_date)
	end as ranking
from CTE
order by customer_id, order_date, price DESC 
```
